# Movie-Recommendation-System

This is the primary README file, containing all the information about the project I've undertaken to create and deploy a movie recommendation system from the ground up.

Within this file, you'll find the following key sections:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Content-Based Filtering Techniques
